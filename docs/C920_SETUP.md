## Setup Instructions

### 1. Physical Setup
- Mount C920 on stable tripod or desk mount
- Position 30-50cm from calibration grid

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Blurry Images**: 
   - Clean lens with microfiber cloth
   - Ensure adequate lighting for autofocus
   - Check USB connection stability

2. **Grid Detection Fails**:
   - Improve lighting uniformity
   - Ensure grid is completely flat
   - Adjust camera distance (30-50cm optimal)

3. **Poor 3D Reconstruction**:
   - Take more images from different angles
   - Ensure sufficient overlap between views
   - Maintain consistent lighting across all shots
